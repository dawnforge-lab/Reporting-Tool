2.  A breakdown of these features into high-level development tasks (Backend, Database, Frontend, Testing).
3.  A three-phased approach (MVP, Expanding Core, Advanced Features & Polish) with target timelines.
4.  Implicit handling of dependencies by the order of features within phases.
5.  A section on cross-cutting concerns.

The plan is now ready.
