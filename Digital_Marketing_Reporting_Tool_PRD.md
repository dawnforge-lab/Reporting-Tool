# Product Requirements Document: Digital Marketing Reporting Tool

## 1. Introduction

The Digital Marketing Reporting Tool is a platform designed to help digital marketers and analysts consolidate, analyze, and understand their marketing data. By connecting to various data sources, users can generate reports, gain AI-driven insights, and perform basic Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM). The primary purpose of this tool is to simplify data analysis and reporting, enabling users to make more informed decisions to optimize their marketing strategies. This document outlines the requirements for the initial development phase.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals for the next phase of development are:

*   **Solidify core functionality:** Ensure the fundamental features (data connection, reporting, basic AI insights, and MMM) are operational and reliable.
*   **Achieve initial user adoption for feedback:** Onboard a select group of users to gather critical feedback for iterative improvement.
*   **Establish a stable platform for future enhancements:** Build a robust and scalable architecture that can support future development and expansion of features.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users for the Digital Marketing Reporting Tool are:

*   **Digital Marketing Managers:** Individuals responsible for overseeing and executing digital marketing strategies, requiring a clear view of performance across channels.
*   **Marketing Analysts:** Professionals focused on data analysis, reporting, and deriving insights to inform marketing decisions.
*   These users are typically part of **small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs)** that may not have access to or resources for more complex enterprise-level analytics platforms.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1. Data Source Management

*   **Description:** Allow users to reliably connect, manage, and view the status of various data sources.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Robust connection wizard for each supported source type:
        *   BigQuery
        *   Google Spreadsheets
        *   Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL - specify which ones for initial phase)
        *   CSV/Excel file uploads
    *   Secure storage of credentials (e.g., using a dedicated vault service or encrypted environment variables). OAuth for services like Google BigQuery and Google Spreadsheets is preferred where applicable.
    *   Clear status indicators for each connection (e.g., Connected, Error, Needs Re-authentication, Syncing).
    *   Ability to edit connection parameters (e.g., update credentials, change table/sheet) and delete existing connections.
    *   Basic data validation upon connection (e.g., check for required columns/fields for certain report types, preview a sample of data).

### 4.2. Reporting Engine

*   **Description:** Enable users to generate, view, and customize reports from connected data sources.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Selection of at least 2-3 pre-defined report templates:
        *   Performance Overview (key metrics across all connected sources)
        *   Channel Comparison (side-by-side performance of different marketing channels)
        *   Custom Report (allow selection of data source and key dimensions/metrics)
    *   Basic customization options for reports:
        *   Dynamic date ranges (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range).
        *   Ability to select metrics and dimensions from the available data in the connected source.
    *   Ability to save report configurations for quick access later.
    *   Option to export reports in standard formats:
        *   PDF
        *   CSV
    *   Clean, readable, and intuitive report visualization (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, tables for detailed data).

### 4.3. AI Insights Module (DeepSeek Integration)

*   **Description:** Provide users with actionable insights generated from their marketing data using the DeepSeek model.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Ability to trigger insight generation for selected connected data sources and/or specific reports.
    *   Focus on generating clear, concise, and actionable recommendations (e.g., "Channel X shows a 20% increase in conversion rate this week, consider allocating more budget," or "Ad Y has a declining click-through rate, review ad copy or targeting").
    *   Display insights contextually alongside relevant report data or in a dedicated insights panel.
    *   Allow users to provide feedback on insight quality (e.g., thumbs up/down, simple text feedback). This feedback will be used to improve the insight generation model.

### 4.4. Marketing Mix Modeling (Meridian Integration)

*   **Description:** Offer a simplified interface for users to perform basic Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) by leveraging Google's open-source Meridian library (`https://github.com/google/meridian`). Users will be able to choose when to apply this modeling to their data.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   A guided workflow for setting up an MMM project:
        *   Selecting relevant data sources (e.g., spend data, conversion data).
        *   Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (e.g., conversions, revenue).
        *   Identifying marketing channels and their associated spend and performance metrics.
        *   Specifying date ranges for the model.
    *   Clear presentation of model results:
        *   Calculated ROI per channel.
        *   Contribution of each channel to the defined KPI.
        *   Basic budget allocation suggestions based on model outputs (e.g., "Consider shifting X% of budget from Channel A to Channel B for potentially higher returns").
    *   Tooltips or embedded help text to explain core MMM concepts, assumptions, and limitations to non-expert users.

### 4.5. User Authentication and Authorization

*   **Description:** Basic user registration and login functionality to secure access to the tool and user-specific data.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   User registration using email and password.
    *   User login with registered credentials.
    *   Secure password storage (e.g., using strong hashing algorithms like Argon2 or bcrypt, with per-user salts).
    *   (Future Consideration, but to be kept in mind for architecture) Basic role-based access control (RBAC) - initially, all users might have the same permissions, but the system should be designed to accommodate roles like 'Admin' and 'User' in the future.

## 5. Success Metrics

The success of this initial development phase will be measured by:

*   **Number of successful data source connections:** Total unique data sources successfully connected by users.
*   **Number of reports generated:** Total reports created and viewed by users.
*   **User engagement with AI insights:**
    *   Number of insights generated.
    *   Number of feedback instances (thumbs up/down) on AI insights.
*   **Number of registered users:** Total users who have successfully created an account.
*   **Qualitative feedback from initial users:** Feedback gathered through surveys, interviews, or support channels regarding usability, feature satisfaction, and pain points.
*   **Platform stability:** Low number of critical bugs and system outages.

## 6. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for this PRD)

The following features and enhancements are considered for future development phases but are out of scope for the current PRD:

*   **Advanced report customization:**
    *   Drag-and-drop report builder.
    *   Calculated metrics.

*   **Alerting and notifications:** Customizable alerts for significant changes in metrics or new AI insights.
*   **Data transformation capabilities (ETL):** Basic data cleaning and transformation options within the platform.
*   **Version control for reports and MMM projects.**
*   **API access for programmatic data retrieval and report generation.**
*   **Integration with more advanced MMM features from Meridian or other libraries.**
